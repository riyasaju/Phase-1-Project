                <div> My name is Riya, and as you all can guess,I am a big snow globe lover. I have always wondered how beautiful they look and the meaning behind it. A few of them have been given to me as gifts whereas a few I bought because it reminded me of something I love dearly. The first few blogs include some of my snowglobes and the stories behind them. Hope that you will enjoy reading! </div>
